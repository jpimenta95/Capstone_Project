# Report Week 4

## Problem and discussion

I choose the first idea "In Module 3, we explored New York City and the city of Toronto and segmented and clustered their neighborhoods. Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city? I will leave it to you to refine this idea.""

So, in that case i can compare New York City, Toronto, Paris and other multicultural city like London.


## Data

I'll use same example that i used in Module 3 and replicate that to Paris and London.
